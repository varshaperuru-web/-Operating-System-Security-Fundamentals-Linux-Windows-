# -Operating-System-Security-Fundamentals-Linux-Windows-
Operating System Security Fundamentals (Linux &amp; Windows) covers core concepts of protecting OS-level resources, including user authentication, permissions, access control, malware protection, firewalls, updates, and system hardening practices to prevent unauthorized access and attacks.
# 🛡️ Operating System Security Fundamentals (Linux & Windows)

## 📌 Description
This repository documents the fundamentals of Operating System Security using Linux and Windows. It focuses on OS-level protection mechanisms such as user accounts, permissions, access control, firewalls, process management, and system hardening practices.

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand OS-level security mechanisms
- Explore Linux and Windows security features
- Learn basic system hardening techniques
- Reduce system attack surface using best practices

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
### Primary Tools
- Ubuntu Linux (Virtual Machine)
- Windows Defender
- Windows Firewall
### Alternative Tools
- Kali Linux
- Fedora Linux

## 🖥️ Environment Setup
- Installed a Linux Virtual Machine using VirtualBox
- Used Windows host OS for native security configuration
- Maintained isolation between host and VM for safe experimentation

## 🔐 User Accounts & Authentication
- Studied administrator vs standard user roles
- Understood Linux root and normal users
- Learned how authentication prevents unauthorized access

## 📂 File Permissions & Access Control
### Linux Permissions
- Read (r), Write (w), Execute (x)
- Permissions define what actions a user can perform on files and directories
- Proper permission settings prevent unauthorized file access and modification

### Windows Permissions
- Read, Write, Modify, Full Control
- Used to restrict access to sensitive files and folders
- Helps enforce role-based access control

## 🌐 Remote Access & Permission Control
- Controlled remote access using secure authentication methods
- Restricted administrative privileges to trusted users only
- Prevented unauthorized remote logins through proper permission management
- Reduced security risks caused by excessive remote access rights

## ⚙️ Process & Service Management
- Identified active processes and running services
- Analyzed services that start automatically during system boot
- Disabled unnecessary services to minimize the attack surface
- Improved overall system stability and security

## 🛠️ OS Hardening Best Practices
- Applied regular system and security updates
- Enforced strong password policies
- Limited administrator and root access
- Enabled and configured firewalls
- Disabled unused services and applications
- Monitored system logs for suspicious activities

## ✅ OS Security Checklist
- [x] User and group permissions configured
- [x] Administrator and root access restricted
- [x] File permissions reviewed and secured
- [x] Firewall enabled and verified
- [x] Unnecessary services disabled
- [x] System updated with latest patches

## 🌍 Real-World Security Scenario
If a malicious file is downloaded by a standard user, operating system security mechanisms prevent it from modifying critical system files unless administrator or root privileges are granted, thereby protecting the system.

## 📘 Learning Outcomes
- Gained understanding of OS-level security fundamentals
- Learned practical system hardening techniques
- Understood the importance of permissions and access control
- Developed awareness of protecting systems against common threats

## 🏁 Conclusion
This task provided hands-on exposure to operating system security fundamentals. Applying proper permissions, access control, and hardening practices helped strengthen system security and reduce potential attack vectors.
